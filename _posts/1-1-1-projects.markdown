title: MSc Thesis - Summarising How a Software API is Used Using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing Techniques
description: |
---

<br>

* A framework that successfully confronts the problem of API Usage Mining.

* The system leverages powerful clustering techniques, such as the k-medoids or the HDBSCAN algorithms, in order to cluster similar usage examples, based on their API call sequences.

* With the aim of presenting the most representative snippet from each cluster, it also considers the structure of the source code, by making use of a tree edit distance metric.

* Additionally, it exploits the power of a novel summarisation algorithm, that has been implemented as part of this project, in order to produce concise and readable snippets, which it presents to the users, in an order that indicates their popularity.

* The report of the thesis is available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m8uaxa967o3khtp/report.pdf?dl=0).
