* [Mantissa](http://mantissa.ee.auth.gr:5050/) is an RSSE (Recommendation System in Software Engineering) that allows searching for software components in growing repositories.

* The system extracts the query from the source code of the developer, employs CSEs such as GitHub to search for available source code, and ranks the retrieved results using the Vector Space Model (VSM).

* Various techniques from the area of Information Retrieval (IR) are employed in order to best rank the results.

* Additional source code transformations are performed so that each result can be ready-to-use by the developer.

* Each result is presented along with relevance scoring and useful information indicating its original source code, its control flow, as well as any
external dependencies.

* This project contains work from the MEng thesis submitted while being an undergraduate student at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The report of the thesis is available in Greek [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d70b8q7v83u74li/Katirtzis_Nikolaos_TDD_Reuse.pdf?dl=0).
