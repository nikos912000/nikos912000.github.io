title: CLAMS (CLustering for API Mining of Snippets)
description: |
---

<br>

* A framework for mining API snippets.

* CLAMS clusters a large set of usage examples based on what API methods they call. It then generates summarised versions for the top snippets of each cluster using a simple summarisation algorithm, and selects the most representative snippet from each cluster, using a tree edit distance metric on the ASTs.

* This results in a set of high quality API usage examples in the form of concise and readable snippets, thus enabling and supporting source code reuse even in cases of libraries with sparse or minimal documentation.

* Method is entirely data-driven, requiring only syntactic information from the program, and so is programming-language agnostic.

* This project contains work from the MSc thesis submitted while being a postgraduate student at University of Edinburgh. The report of the thesis is available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m8uaxa967o3khtp/report.pdf?dl=0).
