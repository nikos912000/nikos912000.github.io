* I am part of Hotels.com Customer Retention Team (CRT), which is responsible for designing and building technical solutions on how customers are identified, sign up for an account, and sign in to their account.

* The team follows the Scrum process, while we pursue popular Agile practices, including Pair Programming, CI, TDD, and BDD.

* The technologies I use as part of the team include, among others, Java, Spring, TestNG, Mockito, and Docker.
